I learned a lot through my collaboration with INCO. It was a great opportunity to work with Emile Ledure, UX Designer, and INCO's team. Starting from the guide they created, Powher in Tech, we created an interactive interface to help companies focus on practical measures to foster diversity, and avoid of bias.
